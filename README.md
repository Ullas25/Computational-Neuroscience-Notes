Computational Neuroscience course is offered by the [University of Washigton](https://www.washington.edu/) through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course instructors are Prof. [Rajesh P. N. Rao](https://www.rajeshpnrao.com/) and Prof. [Adrienne Fairhall](https://pbio.uw.edu/directories/faculty/entry/afairhall/).

The course is an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding nervous system. The recommended textbook for the course is [Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems by Laurence F. Abbott and Peter Dayan](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~lmate/biblio/dayanabbott.pdf). I have uploaded my python solutions to exercise of chapter 1 of this text book, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Ullas25/Theoretical-Neuroscience).
